Firmware for SmartIrrigator Project

The project involves an automatic irrigation system that uses a microcontroller to monitor soil moisture via a sensor. When the moisture level drops below a certain threshold, the controller activates a valve to release water to the plants. The sensor data is sent to a cloud server using the MQTT protocol, enabling remote monitoring and control of the system through an API.
